## üö® Error Code 428: Rate Limiting (Most Common Issue)

### What is Error 428?
Error 428 means **WhatsApp is rate limiting your connection attempts**. This is WhatsApp's protection against too many connection requests in a short time.

### Signs of Error 428:
- "Connection Terminated by Server" with error code 428
- QR codes generate but mobile scanning fails
- "Can't add new devices at this time" on mobile
- Connections drop after 20-60 seconds

### Root Causes:
1. **Too many QR code generations** (every QR refresh counts as an attempt)
2. **Multiple simultaneous connections** from same IP
3. **Rapid reconnection attempts** after failures
4. **Previous session cleanup not done** properly

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Solutions

### Step 1: Stop All Current Connections
```bash
# Kill the server and wait 15 minutes
cd "D:\Whatsapp Programm\baileys-server"
# Press Ctrl+C to stop server
```

### Step 2: Clean All Sessions
```bash
# Clean all old session files
node cleanup-sessions.js
```

### Step 3: Wait and Use Single Connection
- **WAIT 15-30 minutes** before trying again
- Generate **only ONE QR code** at a time
- Don't refresh QR codes rapidly
- Use different WhatsApp accounts for testing

## üìã Mobile Connection Checklist

### Before Scanning QR Code:
- [ ] Only ONE active QR code session
- [ ] Waited at least 15 minutes since last attempt
- [ ] WhatsApp app is updated to latest version
- [ ] Phone has stable internet connection
- [ ] Not using VPN or proxy on mobile
- [ ] Account hasn't hit 4-device limit

### During QR Scan:
- [ ] Hold phone steady and close to screen
- [ ] Ensure good lighting on QR code
- [ ] Don't move phone until "Device linked" appears
- [ ] Keep WhatsApp app open during linking process

### After Scanning:
- [ ] Wait for "Device connected" notification
- [ ] Don't close WhatsApp app immediately
- [ ] Check if session shows "connected" status

## üîß Server Configuration Changes

### Reduce Rate Limiting:
```typescript
// In SessionManager.ts - Longer delays between attempts
const socket = makeWASocket({
  qrTimeout: 300_000,           // 5 minutes (increased)
  connectTimeoutMs: 300_000,    // 5 minutes (increased)
  keepAliveIntervalMs: 60_000,  // 1 minute (increased)
  retryRequestDelayMs: 5000,    // 5 seconds (increased)
  maxMsgRetryCount: 3,          // Reduce retries
  
  // Enhanced reconnection delays
  reconnectDelay: errorCode === 428 ? 900000 : 60000, // 15min for 428, 1min others
})
```

## üì± Mobile-Specific Issues

### Android Issues:
- **Clear WhatsApp cache**: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí WhatsApp ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache
- **Reset network settings** if using mobile data
- **Disable battery optimization** for WhatsApp
- **Update Google Play Services**

### iOS Issues:
- **Force close and reopen WhatsApp**
- **Check iOS version compatibility**
- **Reset network settings**: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Reset Network Settings
- **Ensure automatic app updates are enabled**

### Network Issues:
- **Switch between WiFi and mobile data** when scanning
- **Disable VPN/proxy** on mobile device
- **Check firewall settings** on desktop
- **Use same network** for both devices if possible

## üö´ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't spam QR generation** - Wait between attempts
2. **Don't use multiple sessions** - One at a time only  
3. **Don't ignore wait times** - 15+ minutes between failures
4. **Don't use same phone number** for multiple test accounts
5. **Don't refresh QR immediately** - Let it expire naturally

## ‚ö° Advanced Solutions

### Method 1: Pairing Code Instead of QR
```javascript
// Use phone number + pairing code method
{
  "id": "mobile_account_001",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",  // Your WhatsApp number
  "usePairingCode": true
}
```

### Method 2: Different IP Address
- Use mobile hotspot instead of WiFi
- Try from different location/network
- Use VPN on desktop (not mobile)

### Method 3: Fresh WhatsApp Account
- Create new WhatsApp Business account
- Use different phone number for testing
- Don't link more than 2 devices initially

## üìä Connection Status Meanings

| Status | Description | Action Needed |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `connecting` | Initial connection | Wait 30-60 seconds |
| `error 428` | Rate limited | Wait 15-30 minutes |
| `qr_expired` | QR code timeout | Generate new QR (don't rush) |
| `connected` | Success! | Device is linked |
| `disconnected` | Link lost | Check mobile connection |

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Check Server Logs:
```bash
# Look for these patterns in server logs
grep "error code: 428" logs/
grep "Connection Terminated" logs/
grep "rate limit" logs/
```

### Monitor Connection Patterns:
```bash
# Check active sessions
curl http://localhost:3005/api/stats

# Check specific account
curl http://localhost:3005/api/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/status
```

### Test Basic Connectivity:
```bash
# Test WhatsApp servers
curl -I https://web.whatsapp.com
ping web.whatsapp.com
```

## üí° Success Tips

### For Development:
1. **Use dedicated test WhatsApp numbers**
2. **Limit testing to 2-3 attempts per hour**
3. **Keep session files clean** with regular cleanup
4. **Document successful configurations**
5. **Test during off-peak hours** (early morning)

### For Production:
1. **Use WhatsApp Business API** for higher limits
2. **Implement proper session persistence**
3. **Add connection retry logic** with exponential backoff
4. **Monitor connection health** with heartbeat checks
5. **Have backup phone numbers** ready

## üÜò Emergency Recovery

### If Completely Blocked:
1. **Stop all WhatsApp activity** for 24 hours
2. **Use different device/network** for testing
3. **Contact WhatsApp Business support** if business account
4. **Switch to different phone numbers** temporarily

### Alternative Testing Methods:
- **Use WhatsApp Web directly** to test QR functionality
- **Test on different mobile devices** to isolate issues
- **Use WhatsApp Business Desktop** for comparison
- **Try at different times of day** to avoid peak usage
